Specifications of the code

Main.cpp
There are six .cpp files.Each sorting algorithms have their own .cpp file with respective implementation. All the algorithms are driven by main.cpp file. The main.cpp file includes the generating the permutations to pass them to test the sorting algorithms permutation. It also includes generating gap sequences for shell sort and two different temperature and repitition sequence for annealing sort.
The main runs all the test with increasing size and records and writes the time taken to run each implementation. 

Makefile
To run the code please make first. The Makefile compile and links all the prprogram and outputs an executable run.sh. The program can be then tested by running sort_algorithm.
